stonx.xfs
=========

This is the Atari-/MiNT-part of STonX-fs.
The xfs consists of three parts:
    - file system to access the linux host file system (u:\linux)
    - device driver to access the linux modem device (u:\dev\serial2)
    - device driver for communication MiNT <-> STonX (u:\dev\stx_com)

If you got stonx.xfs sources with STonX note:
   - To compile the xfs you need the source tree of FreeMiNT (at least
     version 1.15.10b). Copy (symbolic link does not work!) all files
     of this directory to sys/xfs/stonxfs (last subdirectory should be
     new) at the FreeMiNT source tree. Call "make" after coping the
     files will make stonx.xfs.
