2004-08-15  Thomas Huth,  STonX-0.6.7.6

	* audio.c, di_dis.c, di_dis.h, x.c, xlib_vdi.c, mint/mint_stonxfs_fs.c:
	  Did some source code beautifications.

2003-12-12 14:15  Thomas Huth

	* Makefile.in: Replaced "tail +2" by "tail -n +2" for Gentoo Linux
	and new POSIX compliance

2003-12-09 18:13  Thomas Huth

	* etc/keysyms-spanish: Added Gabriel Huertas' spanish keysyms file.

2003-11-27 21:15  Thomas Huth

	* mem.h: Fixed the two inline assembler functions SM_W() and
	SM_UW().

2003-11-21 09:49  Thomas Huth

	* Makefile.in: Added additional check for makedepend to avoid an
	  error message during configure if no makedepend is available.

2003-11-21 09:40  Thomas Huth

	* xlib_vdi.c: Commented out a useless line that caused some trouble
	  with the C preprocessor on Mac OS X.

2003-11-21 09:25  Thomas Huth

	* gemdos.c: Added some extra space after a local dirent variable
	  since dirent.d_name is not big enough on some systems like Irix
	  5.3

2003-11-20 16:51  Thomas Huth

	* cpu.c, defs.h, gendefs.m4: Renamed the CPU exception defines
	  since some of them (T_BUSERR, T_ADDRERR and T_TRACE) conflicted
	  with a system include file on NetBSD/68k.

2003-11-20 16:44  Thomas Huth

	* .cvsignore: Added tosfonts and fnttobdf to the .cvsignore file.

	* main.c: config.h is now correctly included.

2003-11-15 23:00  Thomas Huth

	* Makefile.in: Removed "-I." from the Makefile.in so that <audio.h>
	  is correctly included in audio.c on Irix 5.3. (Thanks to Frank
	  Wille)

2003-11-15 22:58  Thomas Huth

	* defs.h: Removed unused defines that caused a conflict on Irix 5.3

2003-11-15 22:57  Thomas Huth

	* x.c, audio.c: Changed C++ comments into normal C comments (for
	  old compilers)


2003-09-20 Thomas Huth, STonX-0.6.7.5
	* Bugfixes for ABCD and SBCD opcodes.
	* STonX now quits and no longer hangs when a program stops the CPU
	  with the STOP #$2700 instruction.

2003-05-11 Thomas Huth
	* The pexec code in the cartridge.img now uses mode=6 instead of mode=4
	  if possible. With mode=4 the memory of a started program is lost
	  after its termination.

2003-02-13 Thomas Huth
	* Changed load_tos() : STonX can now load 512kB ROM images, too
	  (usefull for running EmuTOS).

2003-01-31 Thomas Huth
	* Improved the Makefile.in ("make install" should work better now).
	* Updated the documentation a little bit.

2002-12-27 Thomas Huth
	* Fixed shared-memory code in x.c to also work on my system (Linux/PPC)

2002-10-05 Thomas Huth
	* Cleaned up configure.in (Endianness auto detection, extra files
	  in the config/ subdirectory are no longer needed, config.h is
	  now generated from config.h.in).
	* Audio now also works on Linux/PPC.

2001-12-29 Thomas Huth
	* Merged the shutdown code from the m68k-stuff folder into the cartridge
	* Removed the menu stuff from the cartridge (it never worked and it is
	  a quite stupid idea to write an emulator menu for the VT52 console).
	* Removed the Makefile and related files in the mint/ folder since
	  they do not fit at all into the autoconf scheme.

2001-10-10 Thomas Huth
	* Updated the new cartridge.img - it should now work with both,
	  EmuTOS and normal TOS versions!

2001-07-24 Alex Bennee
	* Fixed uninitialised pointer is FS array causing crash when setting up
	  multiple floppy disk drives.

2001-07-21 Alex Bennee, STonX-0.6.7.4
	* Updated tweaks and fixes to configure/Makefile and new rpm building .spec

2001-07-16 Alex Bennee
	* Fixed re-init of native gemdos that was causing TOS1.0 to fail
	
2001-07-04 Alex Bennee
	* Updated and Improved monitor functionality

2001-06-29 Frank Naumann
	* Don't include sys/statvfs.h, default to include sys/vfs.h.
	
2001-06-28 Frank Naumann
	* #ifndef'ed MONITOR define for the case it's declared in config.h.
	
2001-06-28 Frank Naumann
	* Pass through configure defines, conditional include of the right
	  mount/statfs/vfs header files.
	
2001-06-28 Frank Naumann
	* Small fixes to correctly compile under NetBSD.
	
2001-06-28 Frank Naumann
	* Added .cvsignore files to prevent cvs complaining about generated
	  or compiled files.

2001-06-21 Alex Bennee
	* Fixed the MONITOR functionality (but reduced functionality)
	
2001-04-01 Thomas Huth
	* Fixed some possible buffer overflows in main.c
	* Patched vro_cpyfm in xlib_vdi.c to also work with high and
	  true color modes (but 24bpp does still not yet work).

2001-03-02 Thomas Huth
	* xlib_vdi.c now checks if it can load the normal Atari system fonts,
	  if not, an alternative font will be loaded. So you now can use
	  xlib_vdi without the Atari fonts being installed, too.
	* Included Markus' patches to xlib_vdi.c (white_pixel and black_pixel
	  variables replaced by FIX_COLOR(WHITE) and FIX_COLOR(BLACK));
	* Added an option to options.h to let the user choose if he wants
	  the native BIOS emulation to be compiled in.

2001-02-27 Thomas Huth

	* Removed the TOS_1 define and added code, so that STonX can now
	  use TOS 1 and TOS 2 Roms without being recompiled (changed the
	  files main.c, main.h, cpu.c, mem.h, defs.h and options.h)
	* Updated load_file() in utils.c
	* Set white_pixel and black_pixel variables in xlib_vdi.c so that
	  vsc_form() (-> the mouse pointer form) now works.

2001-02-20  Markus Kohm, STonX-0.6.7.3

	* Bugfixes in x.c

2001-02-13  Till Harbaum, STonX-0.6.7.2

	* Added joystick support.

	* Improved linux sound routines.

	* Added option '-size fullscreen' to x driver.

	* Improved mouse handling (no warping, atari and x mouse 
	  always match).
	
	* Keysym parsing now accepts decimal and hex constants,
	  new german Keymap.G file.

	* Default vbl frequency increased to 50Hz for fluid mouse
	  movement and correct speed of final.tos.
	
2001-02-05  Markus Kohm, STonX-0.6.7.1

	* missing DIST files added at Makefile.in

	* recursive make of stonx.xfs fixed

2001-02-05  Markus Kohm

	* Added shutdown-native call at cartridge memory but without need
	  of cartridge.img.

	* Created sub-makefiles and improved the recursive make of the
	  sub-makefile. Here is work to do (see Makefile.in).

2001-02-04  Markus Kohm

	* stonxfs: added "not installed"-message, in case parts are not
	  activated at STonX.

2001-02-03  Markus Kohm

	* x.c: changed bug at parameter "-wpos <x>:<y>".

	* mint_misc.c: braces added, to avoid compiler warnings.

	* Added missing initialization of serial und communication device.

	* Moved code between files.

2001-02-02  Markus Kohm

	* Complete rearange of stonx.xfs sources.

	* New initialization routine at stonx.xfs.

2001-01-30  Markus Kohm

	* Makefile.in changed to not longer use libSTonXfs4MiNT.

	* STonX creates a cookie at 0xfaf800 (before end of cartridge rom).

	* Chris' changes to add a communication and a serial MiNT device.

	* Optional ungrabbing by mouse button 2 added (MOUSE2_UNGRABS).

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* Chris' changes to grab mouse and keyboard to STonX and some more
	  changes to leave STonX by SHIFT-PAUSE or to simulate left double
	  with mouse button 2.

	* Additional changes to make Chris' changes optional (see options.h)

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* Chris' changes to optional do not emulate MODEM1

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* gemdos.c:
	  do some outputs only at verbose mode.

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* cpu.c:
	  lots of output is only done at verbose mode

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* audio.c:
	  include <sys/soundcard.h> instead of <linux/soundcard.h>
	  and change comments added.

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* distinction between STonX and STonVGA is simply done by
	  linking, all other modules are same.

	* xlib_vdi.c, x.c:
	  native vdi at xlib_vdi.c uses the pixel by index of x.c, if
	  X-Server is not at indexed 8 bit mode.
	  NOTE: Does only work, if priv_cmap (AFIK this is done).


2001-01-09  Markus Kohm

	* Added thothy's patches.


2001-01-07  Markus Kohm

	* All changes made to my version of STonX
	  (based on STonX-0.6.7-epsilon).



**************** Old change log: ****************


Version 0.6 (Dec 21, 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Emulation code has been almost completely rewritten, resulting in 
  1) 20-80% speed increase, 65% on my Linux PC and 80% on our Alphas
  2) Less memory and more time needed to compile cpu.c 
  3) More easily maintainable code
- experimental implementation of the -size option
- added Griff's patches to main.c to read options from a $HOME/.stonxrc file

Version 0.5 (Nov 30 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Integrated sound, serial and parallel port support
- Fixed a few bugs, e.g. the one that caused the Alpha console crash
- Added colormap sharing (#define NEWCOLOR 1 in screen.c)
- Added a Unix filesystem interface (option -fs, file gemdos.c)
- More assembly support for x86
- mkfonts.sh is now a /bin/sh script
- TOS 1.X support where X=0,2,4. Executing programs over the Unix filesystem
  interface may not work with TOS <1.4 (sorry)
- Timer C is now optionally 200Hz

Version 0.4 Beta (Jul 25 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- first public release
- Integrated Griff's blitter emulator
- The VDI driver redraws at expose events now
- The VDI driver works with monochrome displays now, and -DMONO has been 
  eliminated
- Little-endian fixes for the VDI driver and fnttobdf
- Linux port and assembly support
- Emulation is a bit faster now for some instructions
- Condition codes N,Z are now evaluated lazily (this makes STonX incompatible
  with the real 68000 in some rare cases, but I haven't seen code that uses
  this)

Version 0.3 Alpha (Apr 15 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed 12 bit FAT assumption and Media-Change bug, large diskfiles work now
- Improved the VDI driver, now it looks almost exactly like TOS VDI
- Wrote programs to help convert GEM Bitmap Fonts to BDF format

Version 0.2 Alpha (Apr 13 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed invalid initialisation of sigset_t variable in hw.c
- Fixed problem with multiple keycodes mapped to the same Keysym.
  This prevented e.g. a keyboard reset with the usual combination if both the
  normal and the Keypad Del key were mapped to the "Delete" keysym.
- Fixed description of 8th change above. :-) (on -> off)
- Changed the default frequencies to something more reasonable
- Implemented (simple) VDI input functions
- It is now possible to switch between the `old style' window and the VDI
  window at runtime. This feature may disappear in the future.
- X events are now processed at every VBL, not at every screen update
- The `old style' window is not updated if the X pointer is in the VDI
  window
- Added -DSMALL for people with less memory and/or patience
- Added a chmod +w Makefile to Makefile.in (make depend rule)
- Changed stricmp() to strncasecmp()

First version with a version number - Version 0.1 Alpha (Apr 11 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added -refresh option
- Wrote an `Autoconf' script
- Removed the Xlib calls from the signal handler
- Use sigaction() instead of signal() (Thanks to Des Herriott for the hint!)
- Added global register variable declarations for SGIs (untested)
- Fixed bug in colormap handling which bloated up the Xserver if colormap
  changed frequently
- Fixed bug which caused bus errors at naughty accesses to $ff8206
  (Grav2 runs now! ;-))
- The keyboard auto repeat is now only turned off if the X mouse pointer is
  inside the emulator window
- Merged some patches for little-endian machines and little-endian frame buffers
  (untested)


In the beginning there were absurd plans, long sleepless nights, and incredible
boredom...
