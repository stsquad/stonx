        * Removed the TOS_1 define and added code, so that STonX can now
          use TOS 1 and TOS 2 Roms without being recompiled (changed the
          files main.c, main.h, cpu.c, mem.h, defs.h and options.h)
        * Updated load_file() in utils.c
        * Set white_pixel and black_pixel variables in xlib_vdi.c so that
          vsc_form() (-> the mouse pointer form) now works.

2001-02-20  Markus Kohm, STonX-0.6.7.3

        * Bugfixes in x.c
	
2001-02-13  Till Harbaum, STonX-0.6.7.2

	* Added joystick support.

	* Improved linux sound routines.

	* Added option '-size fullscreen' to x driver.

	  always match).
	
	* Keysym parsing now accepts decimal and hex constants,
	  new german Keymap.G file.

 	* Default vbl frequency increased to 50Hz for fluid mouse
	  movement and correct speed of final.tos.

	* missing DIST files added at Makefile.in

	* recursive make of stonx.xfs fixed

2001-02-05  Markus Kohm

	* Added shutdown-native call at cartridge memory but without need
	  of cartridge.img.

	* Created sub-makefiles and improved the recursive make of the
	  sub-makefile. Here is work to do (see Makefile.in).

2001-02-04  Markus Kohm

	* stonxfs: added "not installed"-message, in case parts are not
	  activated at STonX.

2001-02-03  Markus Kohm

	* x.c: changed bug at parameter "-wpos <x>:<y>".

	* mint_misc.c: braces added, to avoid compiler warnings.

	* Added missing initialization of serial und communication device.

	* Moved code between files.

2001-02-02  Markus Kohm

	* Complete rearange of stonx.xfs sources.

	* New initialization routine at stonx.xfs.

2001-01-30  Markus Kohm

	* Makefile.in changed to not longer use libSTonXfs4MiNT.

	* STonX creates a cookie at 0xfaf800 (before end of cartridge rom).

	* Chris' changes to add a communication and a serial MiNT device.

	* Optional ungrabbing by mouse button 2 added (MOUSE2_UNGRABS).

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* Chris' changes to grab mouse and keyboard to STonX and some more
	  changes to leave STonX by SHIFT-PAUSE or to simulate left double
	  with mouse button 2.

	* Additional changes to make Chris' changes optional (see options.h)

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* Chris' changes to optional do not emulate MODEM1

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* gemdos.c:
	  do some outputs only at verbose mode.

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* cpu.c:
	  lots of output is only done at verbose mode

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* audio.c:
	  include <sys/soundcard.h> instead of <linux/soundcard.h>
	  and change comments added.

2001-01-25  Markus Kohm

	* distinction between STonX and STonVGA is simply done by
	  linking, all other modules are same.

	* xlib_vdi.c, x.c:
	  native vdi at xlib_vdi.c uses the pixel by index of x.c, if
	  X-Server is not at indexed 8 bit mode.
	  NOTE: Does only work, if priv_cmap (AFIK this is done).


2001-01-09  Markus Kohm

	* x.c: AltGr-Bug fixed
