INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

In order to compile STonX, you will need the following:

 * A C compiler, preferably GNU C (but some ANSI C compilers, like DEC's
  will do)

 * The M4 macro processor

 * X11R5 or R6 libraries
 
These will suffice to get you started (unless I've forgotten something). 


CONFIGURATION
=============

STonX uses a "configure" script generated by Cygnus' Autoconf program in order
to determine system-dependent configuration parameters. Invoke the script
by typing

	./configure

or, alternatively, 

	sh configure

if the former doesn't work.

This will generate a `Makefile', link `config.h' to the appropriate file from
the `config' subdirectory and generate dependencies for the Makefile. It will
also generate some more sources.

If the `configure' script fails, please contact me at nino@complang.tuwien.ac.at
and send me the output it generated. 


ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
================================

After generating the Makefile, look at the file `options.h' (sparsely commented)
and see if there is anything you want to change. The only options that you might
need to change are TOS_1 (set to 1 is you have a TOS 1.0, 1.2 or 1.4 image)
and SMALL (check if this is defined in the `config.h' as well), which should
be set to 1 if your system has less than 16MB physical memory or if linking
fails otherwise (it will result in an emulator which emulates 4MB RAM instead
of 14MB, and takes up approximately 9MB swap space instead of 17MB).


COMPILING
=========

To compile, simply type 
	
	make

at the shell prompt. If you don't copy your TOS image to the directory
containing the sources named `tos.img' before this point, the `make' process
will stop after STonX has been linked and tell you to do it now. The TOS image
is needed at this point in order to generate the Atari system fonts in .pcf
format. You don't need to do this if you don't want to use the Xlib-VDI
driver. After copying the TOS image, simply type `make' again to continue. The
fonts will be extracted from the TOS image and installed temporarily in the
`data' subdirectory. See the `INSTALLING' section for how to install them
permanently.

After STonX has been compiled and linked successfully, you can start it
by typing

	./stonx

The command-line options can be listed with the `-h' option (`./stonx -h').


INSTALLING
==========

At the moment, STonX can only be run from the directory containing the TOS
image, i.e. there is no automatic system-wide installation. 

The system fonts should be installed in a place where the X server can find
them. Examine your default font path with the `xset' command:

	xset q

This will print (among other things) the current font path. If you copy
the files ending in `.pcf' from the `data' subdirectory to one of the
directories in the font path, go to that directory and do a 

	mkfontdir .; xset fp rehash

the fonts will be installed permanently. Note that if you run STonX on a 
different computer than the one handling your X display, you will have to
install the fonts on the latter.
