Release notes for version 0.6.7.3
=================================

This version fixes some glitches in the x driver.

Release notes for version 0.6.7.2
=================================

This version fixes some problems with the mouse, the linux audio,
comes again with a german Keysym and some changes in the keysym
parser. 

This version has linux joystick support and with the db9 driver
of the linux kernel even supports atari joysticks connected to the
parallel port.

Another new feature is the fullscreen option for the x video driver.

Release notes for version 0.6.7.1
=================================

This version is a improved "almost-there" version of STonX
0.6.7-epsilon. It is improved by a lot of people. Some are shown at
AUTHORS file but there a some more (e.g. the team of S.u.S.E. labs).

Xlib-VDI still does not work, but you can enable it, to see how it 
would work.

A lot of other things work very nice e.g. grabbing and ungrabbing the
mouse and keyboard and freeze STonX if ungrabbed. Most of these new
features are configurable (see options.h).

Some of the nice new features are the native stonxfs routines.
stonxfs.xfs is a filesystem driver to be used at MiNT (see
mint/atari/README).

Release notes for version 0.6.7-epsilon
=======================================

This version is the "almost-there" version of STonX 0.6.7 (which is going
to be the last "release" version before the major changes in the current
development versions are released.

The Xlib-VDI driver is still disabled (sorry) and may or may not be 
re-integrated before the final 0.6.7 release. This depends mostly on
how much work it is to get it to work again after all the latest changes.

Please notify me of any bugs or installation problems as soon as possible
(mail me at nino@complang.tuwien.ac.at), even if you have reported a bug
previously and I haven't had time or forgot to fix it.
