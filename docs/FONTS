Hints for installing the fonts needed by the Xlib-VDI driver (-vdi option):

If you're on a X-Terminal, make sure you install the fonts in a path accessible
by the font server. You'll have to put them in a directory in the tftp hierarchy
if you use tftp. Also make sure that the directory and the fonts are world 
readable. 

If you installed the fonts in a separate path (i.e. none of the ones in the
Font Path shown by "xset q") you need to put something like
xset fp+ <new path> 
into your $HOME/.xinitrc or $HOME/.xsession so that the new path is added to
the system font path every time you start an X session.
