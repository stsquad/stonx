What to do in case of a bug:

1) Look at the list of known bugs on the STonX Web page at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/stonx/

2) If it's not there and you think it's easy to fix, or if you think you can't
   or don't want to help me find it send me e-mail

3) a) If STonX crashes (seg fault etc)
	re-run ./configure --enable-debug
	re-build
	run with gdb
   b) If the emulation fails (program crashes in STonX)
	re-run ./configure --enable-monitor
	re-build
	run with -monitor option to start in monitor
	shift-pause will stop the emualtion and show you where it is

   The MONITOR has been rebuilt so is missing a few(!) features. Its Work in Progress :-)
