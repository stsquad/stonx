What to do in case of a bug:

1) Look at the list of known bugs on my STonX Web page at
   http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/nino/stemu.html

2) If it's not there and you think it's easy to fix, or if you think you can't
   or don't want to help me find it send me e-mail

3) Try installing the debugging environment. You'll need the GNU Binutils, 
   version 2.4 or higher, cross-compiled for a sun2 target. Copy the libraries
   libbfd.a, libopcodes.a, libiberty.a from their directories into the STonX
   directory. Copy the missing header files from the binutils-*/include
   directory into the STonX directory (bfd.h, dis-asm.h etc.). Get a System V
   compatible curses library (ncurses works, as do the libraries in
   /usr/5include and /usr/5lib on old Suns and the OSF/1 libraries). The
   GNU ncurses library also works and is available for most systems. Add
   the necessary -I for the curses library (e.g. -I/usr/include/ncurses for
   Linux) to the CFLAGS in the Makefile. Add -lbfd -lopcodes -liberty -L<curses
   library path> to the STonX linking command (the line following the one
   beginning with stonx: in the Makefile). Set MONITOR to 1 in options.h and
   compile again. Now try to find the problem by using the built-in monitor.
